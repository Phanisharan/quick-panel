# Phone Quick Panel UI 

This project is a simple **Quick Panel UI layout** (like in mobile phones) built with **HTML and CSS and JS**.  
The layout is divided into **Top, Middle, and Bottom sections**, placed inside a main container.  
Each section has its own CSS file to keep things organized, just like in real-world projects.
